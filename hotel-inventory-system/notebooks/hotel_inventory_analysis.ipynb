    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals key insights into the inventory management system, including:\n",
    "- **Top Consumed Items**: The top items by consumption were identified, which can help in prioritizing inventory management efforts.\n",
    "- **Bar Performance**: Consumption patterns across different bars were analyzed, highlighting which bars have higher or lower inventory turnover.\n",
    "- **Forecasting Accuracy**: The Holt-Winters method was used for demand forecasting, providing a more nuanced understanding of expected consumption trends.\n",
    "- **Par Levels**: Optimal par levels were calculated to ensure that inventory is maintained at appropriate levels to meet demand without overstocking.\n",
    "- **Simulation Results**: The simulation provided insights into stockout occurrences and overall service levels achieved during the analysis period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:\n",
    "- **Order Recommendations**: Items that require immediate ordering should be prioritized to avoid stockouts.\n",
    "- **Monitor Inventory Levels**: Regular monitoring of inventory levels against par levels is essential to maintain service quality.\n",
    "- **Adjust Forecasting Models**: Continuously refine forecasting models based on new data to improve accuracy."
